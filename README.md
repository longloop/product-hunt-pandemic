# product-hunt-pandemic
Listing of offerings by people and companies during a Pandemic. This is a website where people can list their offering be it a service or product which they are ready to provide to others. Offerings would be filterable by tags and geo location as well.

* In the current pandemic we foresee a state when a lot of people could be left without resources. Closure of a lot of business would mean a lot of people becoming job less. At that time we need to boost the community to come forward and help the ones in need.  This site can be the place where people who have too-much of something can share with people who have too-less of it.
* Another case, products which gets developed in the time of a crisis like our hackathon, need to have a place from where they can be showcased. This website can be that thing as well. Here people like us can list the thing we developed and other can have a common place to browse them.
* Also, this can be used by companies to list the thing they are offering (for free or lower charge) to people like us (creators). As in low-cost-hosting service, low-cost material for mask production etc.
